**Restaurant Intelligence & Trends Analysis**

A structured data analysis project focused on extracting insights from restaurant datasets, including cuisines, cities, ratings, pricing, delivery options, and geographic patterns. This project is developed as part of a Data Analysis Internship.

**📌 Overview**

The project analyzes restaurant data to understand consumer patterns, identify top cuisines, compare city-level performance, evaluate price ranges, explore delivery behavior, and uncover geographic clusters.
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and comparative insights to reveal trends in the restaurant ecosystem.

**📂 Dataset**

• The dataset includes key attributes such as:

• Restaurant Name

• Cuisines

• City

• Ratings & Votes

• Price Range

• Online Delivery & Table Booking

• Latitude & Longitude

• These fields enable detailed analysis across multiple business dimensions.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**

**Python**

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Matplotlib / Seaborn

• Plotly

**• Jupyter Notebook**

**•Data Visualization tools (for charts, geo-plots)**

**•Optional: Power BI / Tableau for dashboards**

**✅ Level 1 – Exploratory Insights**
**1. Top Cuisines**

• Identify the top 3 cuisines

• Compute restaurant percentage share for each cuisine

**2. City Analysis**

City with the highest restaurant count

• Average rating by city

• City with highest average rating

**3. Price Range Distribution**

• Histogram / bar chart for price ranges

• Percentage distribution across price categories

**4. Online Delivery**

• Share of restaurants offering online delivery

• Rating comparison between delivery vs non-delivery restaurants

**✅ Level 2 – Advanced Insights**
**1. Ratings Distribution**

• Rating range distribution

• Average number of votes

**2. Cuisine Combination Analysis**

• Most common cuisine pairings

• Whether certain combinations correlate with higher ratings

**3. Geographic Analysis**

• Map plot of restaurant locations

• Identify city/area clusters

**4. Restaurant Chains**

• Detect chain restaurants

• Compare ratings & popularity across chains

**✅ Level 3 – Deep Analysis**
**1. Review Text Analysis**

• Identify common positive & negative keywords

• Review length vs rating correlation

**2. Votes Analysis**

• Restaurants with max/min votes

• Correlation between votes and rating

**3. Price Range vs Services**

• Relationship between price range & availability of:

• Online delivery

• Table booking

• Identify whether premium restaurants offer more services

**📊 Dashboard (Optional)**

• A visual dashboard can include:

• City vs Rating heatmap

• Price range breakdown

• Top cuisine chart

• Restaurant distribution map

• Delivery vs rating comparison
