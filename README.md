Restaurant Intelligence & Trends Analysis

A structured data analysis project focused on extracting insights from restaurant datasets, including cuisines, cities, ratings, pricing, delivery options, and geographic patterns. This project is developed as part of a Data Analysis Internship.

📌 Overview

The project analyzes restaurant data to understand consumer patterns, identify top cuisines, compare city-level performance, evaluate price ranges, explore delivery behavior, and uncover geographic clusters.
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and comparative insights to reveal trends in the restaurant ecosystem.
